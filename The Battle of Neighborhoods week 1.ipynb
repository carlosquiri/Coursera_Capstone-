Located in Southeast Texas near Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, it is the seat of Harris County and the principal city of the Greater Houston metropolitan area, which is the fifth-most populous metropolitan statistical area in the United States with a population of 7,0 millions in 2019.\n\nThe humble brewery has evolved into a very successful commercial industry bussines, and craft breweries only continue to rise in popularity as they attract more sales and visitors each year. With the world of craft beer thriving, the opportunity is ripe for starting something of your own. But where do you begin when figuring out how to start a brewery?\n\nThis final project explores the  best locations for for opening a brewery throughout the  city  of  Houston. Potentially  the  owner of this brewery can have great success and consistent profit. However, as with any business, opening a new  location requires serious considerations  and  is  more  complicated  than  it seems from the first glance. In particular, this is one of the most important factors that will affect whether it will have success or a failure.\n"

Using Data Science methodology and instruments such as Data Analysis and Visualization, this project aims to provide solutions to answer the business question: Where should the investor open a Brewery Bussiness? What kinds of people live, work, or visit the neighborhood? as wells as What other breweries or related bussiness are located in the area?"

We are going to use this data to perform further analysis of the neighborhoods."

After it, we will get the geographical coordinates of the neighborhoods (latitude and longitude) using Python Geocoder package. \n\nFinally, we will use Foursquare API to get the venue data for the neighborhoods defined at the previous step. Foursquare has one of the largest databases of 105+ million places and over 125,000 developers use this application. Foursquare API provides manycategories of the venue data; we are particularly interested in the restaurant data to solve the business problem defined above. \n\nThis project will require using of many data science skills, from web scrapping (open source dataset), working with API (Foursquare), data cleaning, data wrangling, to map visualization (Folium). In the next Methodology section,we will discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that we did, any inferential statistical testing that we performed, and what machine learning techniques were used."
